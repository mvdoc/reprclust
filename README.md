Clustering on representational similarities of fMRI data

## Description
This is a work in progress to investigate cluster solutions of task-based representational geometries. See below for poster presentations.

## Code
- `stability` contains the code -- still WIP, API can break from one commit to another.
- `ohbm2015` contains the poster presented at OHBM 2015, and the code to generate the simulation results.
