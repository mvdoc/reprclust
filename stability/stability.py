"""
Module to compute stability estimates of clustering solutions using a method
inspired by Yeo et al. (2011). The procedure cross-validates across
subjects in the following way: the datasets are divided into training and
test set; clustering is performed on the training set, and the solution is
predicted on the test set. Then, the clustering solution is computed on the
test set, and this is compared to the predicted one using the Adjusted Rand
Index or the Adjusted Mutual Information as metrics. Clustering solutions
are swept from k=2 to a maximum k defined by the user.

At the moment the following clustering algorithms are implemented:
    - k-means
    - Gaussian Mixture Models
    - Ward Clustering (structured and unstructured)
    - complete linkage with correlation distance
